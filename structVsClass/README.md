In C++, a struct (short for structure) is a user-defined data type that allows you to group variables of different types together under one name. It's very similar to a class in C++, but by default, members of a struct are public, whereas members of a class are private by default.

#Struct vs Class:

Struct: Members are public by default.
Class: Members are private by default.

Structs are often used for simple data structures, while classes are typically used when you need more advanced features like encapsulation and access control. However, both structs and classes in C++ are essentially the same except for the default access specifier.
